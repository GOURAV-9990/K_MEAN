K-Means and K-Modes are clustering algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning to group data points into clusters based on their similarity.

1. **K-Means Algorithm**:
    - K-Means is used for clustering numerical data.
    - It works by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
    - Steps:
      1. Initialize `k` cluster centroids randomly.
      2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
      3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of the points in each cluster.
      4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
    - It uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity.
    - K-Means is sensitive to outliers and assumes clusters are spherical.

2. **K-Modes Algorithm**:
    - K-Modes is used for clustering categorical data.
    - It minimizes the dissimilarity between data points and cluster modes.
    - Steps:
      1. Initialize `k` cluster modes randomly.
      2. Assign each data point to the cluster with the closest mode (using a dissimilarity measure like Hamming distance).
      3. Update the modes by finding the most frequent category for each attribute in the cluster.
      4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the modes stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
    - K-Modes handles categorical data directly and does not require numerical encoding.

Both algorithms are part of the broader family of clustering techniques and are widely used in data analysis and pattern recognition tasks.
